## 🎭 Design Philosophy

This project merges two powerful cultural influences:

### Franz Kafka's Literary Themes
The interface embodies Kafka's existentialist motifs:

- **Bureaucracy** → Rigid grid patterns and structured layout
- **Alienation** → Dark, oppressive color palette
- **The Absurd** → Juxtaposition of modern videos with historical imagery
- **Authority** → Heavy, imposing visual weight
- **Oppression** → Vignetting effects and dark overlays creating a sense of confinement

### Grundig Television Aesthetics
Inspired by the iconic German TV manufacturer **Grundig** (founded 1945), known for:

- **Minimalist Industrial Design** → Clean lines and functional beauty
- **Speaker Grills** → Distinctive fabric-covered speaker elements flanking the screen
- **Bakelite & Wood Aesthetics** → Dark materials with subtle gradients
- **Analog Controls** → Physical knobs for channel and volume control
- **German Engineering** → Precision and attention to detail in every element

The result is a functional "time machine" that transports users to mid-20th century Central Europe, where Kafka's literary world meets post-war German consumer technology.

## 📚 Cultural Context

This project was created for **ML-2500: Introduction to Cross Cultural Studies** at the **Georgia Institute of Technology**. It explores how design can communicate cultural and philosophical themes through the lens of:

- Post-war German industrial design
- Central European existentialist literature
- Nostalgia and collective memory
- The intersection of art and technology
